# DigitalClock
A project finished during my undergraduate study. I found it at the bottom of my drive. It is simple but quite interesing. For permanent preservation, I pushed it on my Github.

The whole project was developed on __PIC 16F877 MCU__, a quite old stuff. The report was written in Chinese, sorry for the incovenience if you try to read it but end up with foreign characters.
